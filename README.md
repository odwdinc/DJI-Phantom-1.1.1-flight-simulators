Using the DJI Phantom 1.1.1 transmitter with flight simulators 

I don't know if there is much interest in this, I have took some time to decode the serial bus that in the DJI Phantom 1.1.1 transmitter puts out over its internal usb connection  and have created vJoy feeder application. this allows very easy integration in to almost any flight sim.
